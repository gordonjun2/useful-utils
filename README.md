# Useful Utils

A collection of personal utility scripts that I frequently use to automate common tasks and improve workflow efficiency.

## Available Utilities

- [Quick Git Repo Backup](quick_git_repo_backup/)

Automates the process of updating and backing up multiple Git repositories in a directory. Creates a single zip file containing all updated repositories.

- [SRT Subtitle Synchronizer](sync_srt/)

Helps synchronize subtitle timing in .srt files by shifting all timestamps by a specified number of seconds. Useful for fixing subtitle timing misalignments.

## Instructions

Each utility has its own directory with a dedicated README that provides detailed usage instructions and documentation.
